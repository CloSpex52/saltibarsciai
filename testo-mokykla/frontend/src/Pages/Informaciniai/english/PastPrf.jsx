             Level: intermediate

<li>The past perfect is made from the verb had and the past participle of a verb:

I had finished the work.
She had gone.</li>

<li>The past perfect continuous is made from had been and the -ing form of a verb:

I had been working there for a year.
They had been painting the bedroom.</li>

<li>The past perfect is used in the same way as the present perfect, but it refers to a time in the past, not the present. We use the past perfect:

for something that started in the past and continued up to a given time in the past:
When George died, he and Anne had been married for nearly fifty years.
She didn't want to move. She had lived in Liverpool all her life.</li>

<li>For this use, we often use the past perfect continuous:

She didn't want to move. She had been living in Liverpool all her life.
Everything was wet. It had been raining for hours.</li>

for something that happened several times before a point in the past and continued after that point:
He was a wonderful guitarist. He had been playing ever since he was a teenager.
He had written three books and he was working on another one.

when we are reporting our experience up to a point in the past:
My eighteenth birthday was the worst day I had ever had.
I was pleased to meet George. I hadnâ€™t met him before, even though I had met his wife several times.

for something that happened in the past and is important at a later time in the past: 
I couldn't get into the house. I had lost my keys.
Teresa wasn't at home. She had gone shopping.

<li>We often use expressions with for and since with the past perfect:

I was sorry when the factory closed. I had worked there for ten years. 
I had been watching that programme every week since it started, but I missed the last episode. </li>

<li>We do not normally use the past perfect continuous with stative verbs. We use the past perfect simple instead:

Up until that moment, I'd never believed (NOT been believing) in astrology.</li>
